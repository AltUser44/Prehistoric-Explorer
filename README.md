## üé® Customization

### Adding New Dinosaurs

1. **Add dinosaur data** in `lib/realistic-dinosaur-data.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: "new-dinosaur",
  name: "New Dinosaur",
  species: "Dinosaurus newus",
  // ... other properties
}
```


2. **Create the 3D model** in `components/realistic-dinosaur-models.tsx`:

```typescript
function NewDinosaurModel() {
  return (
    <group>
      {/* Your 3D model components */}
    </group>
  )
}
```


3. **Add to the render function**:

```typescript
case "new-dinosaur":
  return <NewDinosaurModel />
```




### Modifying the Environment

Edit `components/realistic-terrain.tsx` to:

- Adjust terrain generation parameters
- Add new environmental features
- Modify tree and rock placement
- Change material properties


### Customizing UI

Modify `components/dinosaur-info-panel.tsx` to:

- Change information display format
- Add new data fields
- Customize styling and animations


## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for environment-specific settings:

```plaintext
# Optional: Analytics or tracking IDs
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id

# Optional: API endpoints for additional data
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api.com
```

### Performance Optimization

The application includes several performance optimizations:

- **Model Preloading**: 3D models are preloaded to prevent loading delays
- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses React Three Fiber's efficient rendering pipeline
- **Texture Optimization**: Procedural textures reduce file size and loading times
- **Physics Optimization**: Simplified collision shapes for better performance


## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Models not loading**

1. Ensure all model files are in the `public/models/` directory
2. Check browser console for loading errors
3. Verify file paths in the dinosaur data



2. **Performance issues**

1. Reduce the number of dinosaurs or environmental objects
2. Lower the geometry detail in model components
3. Disable shadows if needed: remove `shadows` prop from `<Canvas>`



3. **Controls not working**

1. Ensure OrbitControls is properly imported and configured
2. Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
3. Verify Three.js and React Three Fiber versions are compatible





### Browser Compatibility

- **Recommended**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **WebGL Support**: Required for 3D rendering
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Recommended for optimal performance
